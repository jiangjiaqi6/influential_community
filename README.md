# Datasets
We collect 168 real-world networks of various types, along with 3 synthetic graphs, all of which are undirected. Among these datasets, the synthetic graphs Kron29
is generated by Graph500 kronecker (https://graph500.org/). The remaining networks are sourced from the Koblenz Network Collection (http://konect.unikoblenz.de/), the Stanford Network Collection (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/), the Web Graph Collection (http://webgraph.di.unimi.it/)

## Input graph
```
graph:
    1
  /  \
 2 —— 3
edge list format:
1 2
1 3
2 3
```

## Preprocess
goal:Write Binary file From edge list
- format: edge list without n or m or other informations (graph.txt)
- function: write_graph_binary(graph_name)
